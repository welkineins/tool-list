## Terminal
- [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) - Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout. Looking sexy from the start.
- [Cash](https://github.com/dthree/cash) - Cash is a cross-platform implementation of Unix shell commands written in pure ES6.

## Linux Emulator
- [Foreign LINUX](https://github.com/wishstudio/flinux) - Foreign LINUX - Run unmodified Linux applications inside Windows.
