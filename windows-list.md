# Windows Tools

## Terminal
- [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) - Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout. Looking sexy from the start.

## Linux Emulator
- [Foreign LINUX](https://github.com/wishstudio/flinux) - Foreign LINUX - Run unmodified Linux applications inside Windows.
